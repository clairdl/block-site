# Block Site

**Block Site** (formerly known as Stop Social Media) is a simple Chrome extension that improves your productivity by blocking access to distracting websites as you specify.

### Usage

To configure, click on the **B** icon in the toolbar and select **Options** from the menu. Enter sites in the textbox, leaving a new line for each site, like this:
```
facebook.com
